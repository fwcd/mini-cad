# MiniSlice

A parameteric 3D modeller and slicer for macOS and iOS featuring a Swift-inspired Domain Specific Language (DSL) for modeling.

The implemented algorithm for Boolean mesh operations is loosely based on "Efficient Boolean algorithms for triangulated meshes of geometric modeling" by Jiang et al.
