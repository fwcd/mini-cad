// Welcome to MiniCAD, a Swift-like programming language
// for creating 3D models programmatically!

// Code in this editor will automatically be interpreted
// as you type and previewed on the right.

// The 3D viewport can be rotated and moved around by
// clicking and dragging with the mouse or by using
// trackpad/touch gestures.

// To get started, let's create a cuboid of size 5x3x5:

Cuboid(5, 3, 5)

// Try tweaking the size of the cuboid and see what happens!
