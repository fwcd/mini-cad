// Welcome to MiniCAD, a Swift-like programming language
// for creating 3D models programmatically!

// To get started, let's create a cuboid of size 5x4x3:

Cuboid(5, 4, 3)

// Code in this editor will automatically be interpreted
// as you type and previewed on the right. Try it out
// by tweaking the size of the cuboid!
